# üì∞ News Article Summarization

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to automatically summarize lengthy news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The objective is to generate concise, human-readable summaries that retain the core meaning of the original article. We used the pretrained transformer model `t5-small` from Hugging Face for abstractive summarization and showcased the workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
